Design problem: The project structure was not documented.
Design solution: Reviewed the project and added a `project-structure.md` file with a description of the project and the most important files.

Design problem: The terrain generation was too simple (only using 2D noise) and all terrain-related code was in a single file without proper organization.
Design solution:

1. Enhanced terrain generation with sophisticated procedural generation including:
   - 5 climate types (desert, prairie, sparse forest, dense forest, high mountain)
   - River generation with 60% probability
   - Coastline generation with 30% probability
   - Climate-specific tile rules and restrictions
2. Reorganized terrain code into dedicated js/terrain/ folder with:
   - terrain.js: Main terrain generation logic
   - terrain.test.js: Comprehensive unit tests
   - README.md: Complete documentation of features and API

This improves code organization, maintainability, and creates much more varied and realistic terrain generation. The modular structure makes it easier to extend terrain features in the future.
