Design problem: The project structure was not documented.
Design solution: Reviewed the project and added a `project-structure.md` file with a description of the project and the most important files.

Design problem: The terrain generation was too simple (only using 2D noise) and all terrain-related code was in a single file without proper organization.
Design solution:

1. Enhanced terrain generation with sophisticated procedural generation including:
   - 5 climate types (desert, prairie, sparse forest, dense forest, high mountain)
   - River generation with 60% probability
   - Coastline generation with 30% probability
   - Climate-specific tile rules and restrictions
2. Reorganized terrain code into dedicated js/terrain/ folder with:
   - terrain.js: Main terrain generation logic
   - terrain.test.js: Comprehensive unit tests
   - README.md: Complete documentation of features and API

This improves code organization, maintainability, and creates much more varied and realistic terrain generation. The modular structure makes it easier to extend terrain features in the future.

Design problem: Tree positioning logic was embedded in the main game loop, making it difficult to manage, track, and remove trees. Trees were created inline without any way to reference or delete them later for game actions.

Design solution: Extracted tree logic into a dedicated TreeManager class in js/trees/ folder with:

- trees.js: TreeManager class that handles tree positioning, tracking, and removal
- trees.test.js: Comprehensive unit tests for all tree management functionality
- README.md: Complete documentation of the tree management API

The TreeManager provides:

- Centralized tree spawning with configurable probability and rules
- Unique ID tracking for each tree to enable future removal
- Methods to remove trees by ID or coordinates
- Isometric coordinate conversion
- Tree count tracking and display

This separation allows for future game mechanics like tree harvesting, environmental changes, or resource management while keeping the main game loop clean and focused.

Design problem: Tree positioning was too rigid with only one tree per tile positioned at the center, and tree density was constant regardless of terrain climate type. This made forests look unrealistic and didn't reflect the natural variation between different climate zones.

Design solution: Enhanced the TreeManager with climate-based generation system that includes:

- Climate-specific configurations for spawn probability, max trees per tile, and tree spacing
- Flexible positioning system allowing trees to spawn anywhere within tiles using random offsets
- Support for multiple trees per tile with no artificial limits
- Climate types: desert (2% probability, 1 tree max), prairie (15%, 2 trees max), sparse_forest (35%, 3 trees max), dense_forest (65%, 5 trees max), high_mountain (8%, 1 tree max)
- Added radius-based operations for getting and removing trees in areas
- Enhanced tree objects with screen coordinates and offset tracking

The system now creates much more realistic and varied forest layouts that properly reflect different climate zones, while maintaining the ability to track and manage all trees for future game mechanics.
